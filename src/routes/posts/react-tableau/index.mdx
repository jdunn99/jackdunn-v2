## Introduction

### What is Tableau?

Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence software that helps people see and understand their data. It allows users to connect, visualize and share data in a user-friendly and interactive way.

### Why Embedded Tableau

Embedding a Tableau application allows you to integrate your Tableau workbooks into your own services, allowing for more customization and extensibility.

Rather than using a Tableau service that your users can access (like Tableau Reader or Online), you can embed your application and manage everything on your end with Tableaus APIs.

This allows for a more seamless user experience, as well as a more flexible development process.

### Structure of a Tableau Viz

The Tableau application consists of a global **Viz** object which contains all data, filters, parameters, marks (ex. charts & tables), and other user interface.

The Viz contains a **Workbook** which contains a collection of **Sheet** objects (either a **Dashboard**, **Worksheet**, or **Story**). A Sheet is where you build an interface for your data.

A more detailed explanation of the Tableau architecture can be found here.

## Embedding Tableau with React

### Initializing the API

The key component of embedded Tableau is the Tableau Javascript API. To initialize the API, you can paste the following code into your **public/index.html** file.

```typescript
<script
type="text/javascript"
src="https://SERVER_NAME/javascripts/api/tableau-2.min.js"> </script>
```

Where **SERVER_NAME** is the name of your Tableau server you are using. For example, public.tableau.com or online.tableau.com for Tableau public and online.

For usage with NextJS, you can load the script tag using the **`<Head>`** and **`<Script>`** tags in your \_app file.

```jsx
import Head from "next/head";
import Script from "next/script";

function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Head>
        <Script
          src="https://SERVER_NAME/javascripts/api/tableau-2.min.js"
          type="text/javascript"
        />
      </Head>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
}
```

Once the API is added, you can access the Tableau object as a child of the window object.

```js
const { tableau } = window;
```

You can also ensure that the component is mounted before calling the Tableau API via a ref or using a state object.

```jsx
const [tableau, setTableau] = React.useState(null);

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") setTableau(window.tableau);
}, []);
```

### Embedding the Viz

A Viz is the uppermost level of a Tableau instance. To embed a Viz you need the URL of the Viz you want to embed and the container element you want to embed it in. In the Slotfocus Tableau library, we use the container as a Viz component and maintain the actual Viz object stored in a Zustand global store.

If you try to access the Viz object before it is fully loaded, Tableau will throw an error and your app will crash. To solve this problem, you can utilize a Promise and that resolves once the Viz is loaded. You can tell when the Viz is fully loaded through the onFirstInteractive callback in the Viz constructor.

In the example below, we will keep things simple and just use the Viz object as a hook.

```jsx
export const useViz = (ref, url) => {
  // if you want to have acess to any objects below the viz, you have to make sure the viz is loaded
  const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);
  const [viz, setViz] = React.useState(null);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (ref.current) {
      setViz((viz) => {
        if (viz) viz.dispose();
        return new tableau.Viz(ref.current, url, {
          onFirstInteractive: () => setMounted(true), // onFirstInteractive is a callback from the API that tells you when the Viz is fully loaded
        });
      });
    }
  }, [ref, url]);

  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    if (mounted) resolve(viz);
  });
};

export const Component = () => {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);

  // if you don't need to access anything inside the viz and simply want to embed
  useViz(ref, "https://public.tableau.com/views/SampleViz/SampleViz");

  return <div ref={ref} />;
};
```

### Extending the Viz

Once you have embedded the Viz object and it has loaded, you can now access any properties found in the Viz class for the Tabelau Javascript API.

For example, to access the current sheet and select marks:

```jsx
export const Component = () => {
  const ref = React.useRef(null);
  const viz = useViz(
    ref,
    "https://public.tableau.com/views/RegionalSampleWorkbook/College"
  );

  const handleClick = async () => {
    const sheet = (await viz).getWorkbook().getActiveSheet();
    await sheet.selectMarksAsync(
      "College",
      "Engineering",
      tableau.SelectionUpdateType.REPLACE
    );
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div ref={ref} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Export</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
