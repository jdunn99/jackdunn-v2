To use the demo, feel free to either create your own account or use:

**Note**: This project hasn't been maintained since very early 2021, and is somewhat unfinished.
As of 01/11/2022, I have started to update some components, libraries, and fix bugs.

## Introduction
FanStop is a fan-base management system. It allows users to create posts, and subscribe to creators.

## Features and Development

The project consists of a GraphQL webserver built with Apollo server,
and a front-end built in NextJS.

Authorization & authentication is handled with **JSON Web Tokens** (JWTs) encoded in cookies and parsed with custom middleware.

### Profile Page

The profile/main page contains any posts you have made,
a feed of all posts from creators you are subscribed to,
and all the users you are supporting

#### My Posts

On the **My Posts** page, you can see all the posts you have made.
Posts are Paginated using **cursor** based pagination.
If you are viewing your own profile you can edit or delete posts by pressing the corresponding icons.

#### Feed

The **Feed** page contains a feed of all posts from creators you are subscribed to.
They are also paginated using **cursor** based pagination.

#### Supporting

The **Supporting** page contains a list of all users you are supporting. Clicking on a user will take you to their profile.

### Post Page

A post page has two basic states: **Editing** or **Viewing**.
All posts from other profiles default to the **Viewing** state, and you can switch between the two states if the post was created by yourself.

#### Editing State

In the **Editing** state you can modify / create the content of a post.

Each post contains a title and a description, followed by the actual content.
Each piece of content rendered by the editor is wrapped with an **Insert** component that allows you to insert content (either a **Title** or **Text** component) in the corresponding location.

#### Viewing State

The viewing state simply renders the content based on the properties (title, description, content) of the post.
